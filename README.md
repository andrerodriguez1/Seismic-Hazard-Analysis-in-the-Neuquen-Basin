# Seismic Hazard Analysis in the Neuquen Basin, Argentina

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that reproduces the seismic hazard analysis carried out in the Neuqu√©n Basin region, Argentina. The study is based on the methodology and results presented in the research paper:

**Andrea Beatriz Rodriguez**, Centro At√≥mico Ezeiza, CNEA, Argentina

**Mar√≠a Laura Rosa**, Sismolog√≠a, Facultad de Ciencias Astron√≥micas y Geof√≠sicas, UNLP

## üìå Objective

The goal of this project is to estimate the seismic hazard in the Neuqu√©n Basin using a probabilistic approach. The analysis includes catalog compilation, homogenization, declustering, seismic source characterization, and the computation of ground motion exceedance maps using the software **R-CRISIS**.

## üìÅ Files and Structure

- `seismic_hazard.ipynb`: Main notebook with catalog processing, zoning, recurrence analysis, and hazard calculation.
- `Catalogs/`: Contains raw and processed earthquake catalogs.
- `Imagenes/`: Figures and hazard maps used in the notebook and paper.
- `README.md`: Project description and documentation.
- `Seismic Hazard Analysis.docx`: Full research paper including methodology, figures, and results.

## üîç Summary

- A seismic catalog was built from public sources and homogenized to moment magnitude $M_W$.
- The region was divided into eight seismogenic zones based on geological and geophysical criteria.
- Magnitude‚Äìfrequency relationships were calculated for each zone using the Gutenberg‚ÄìRichter law.
- Seismic hazard maps were computed for a return period of 475 years, including:
  - **Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA)**
  - **Spectral Acceleration at T = 0.2s and T = 1s**
- Results show PGA values ranging from **0.14g in the north** to **0.02g in the southeast** of the Neuqu√©n Basin.
